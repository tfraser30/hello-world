# hello-world
This is a little bit about me. I am a data analyst working in supply chain. I have learned about Python after learning SAS programming for data analysis. Python seems the way to go since it is widely used, open source, and lots of collaboration available via github and other places.
My goal is to make a python library that is open source and can be used cross functionally to perform data anaylsis and visualization.
